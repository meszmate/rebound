## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project foundation: buildless CEP extension scaffold, manifest (panel +
  settings extensions), dev tooling, CI, and documentation.
- Easing engine (`bezier`, `penner`, `spring`, `sampler`) with full unit-test
  coverage, including a physical damped-harmonic-oscillator spring.
- Panel↔host bridge with a JSON-envelope RPC, an ExtendScript host (JSON
  polyfill, dispatch core, shared utilities, system + ease commands).
- Reactive store, host theme sync, event bus, DOM helpers, shared unit parser.
- Tool registry (plug-in architecture), reusable UI controls, and the SVG
  curve editor widget.
- **Ease** tool: shape a cubic-bezier, apply it to the selection as native
  temporal ease, read existing ease back, copy/paste `cubic-bezier()`, and a
  built-in Penner preset library.
- Cross-platform dev tooling: PlayerDebugMode toggle, dev install (link/copy),
  icon generator, self-signed cert + ZXP packaging.
- **Spring**, **Library**, **Anchor**, **Align/Distribute**, **Recoil**, **Drift**
  tools.
- **Multiply** (progressive duplicate stack), **Flip** (mirror), **Stagger**
  (time cascade), **Bounce** (gravitational rebound), **Trim** (fit in/out to
  keyframes), **Arrange** (grid), and **Keyframes** (interpolation setters).
  14 tools across 7 groups in total.
